# HE_REloaded for (UE 4.23)
Name subject to change, 
This is my modifided version of the Free Horror Engine Asset for Unreal
The goal of this project is to expand and improve the amazing HorrorEngine Asset

The original HE asset was Developed by tansuergene


The asset was made free to the public Sept 1st 2019
in its current state reloaded only adds a few extra features not found in the base asset
but most would concider these features Key to a horror experience 
These are: 
- Save Load system (Developed by HEs original dev but missing from release version)
- Checkpoint BP
- In game Pause Menu
- Main menu level
- Very basic Graphics options
- Player body
- Fixed Footsteps trigger based on Animation instead of Delays/Timers
- AI with basic footsteps, attacking animations and deals damage


Update 3 Preview build now live: (Not this is a preview and not feature complete shows the start of new contend being added upto and including)
- Moved to 4.23
- Camcorder V2 started
- Cameroid can see "Ghosts" 
(set actor as hidden in game with an actor tag "Ghost" to use the flashlight allow "Hidden shadows" on the mesh)

- AI has slightly better responses but the advanced AI systems needed to be pulled out ATM while I work on them
- AI can die
- Gun now spawns a projectile 
- V1 of directional legs (commonly requested addition)
- New health icon (based on Resident Evils Condition meter)
- Other changes I cant remember that I did ages ago
